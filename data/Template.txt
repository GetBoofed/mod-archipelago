Template for item maps.

"CLASS NAME": {
    "armor": {
        "SPEC NAME": {
            "O" - This is armor for level 10
            "1" - Level 20
            ...
            "7" - Level 80
        }
    },
    "weapons": {
        "SPEC NAME": {
            "0" - Same as armor, level 10
            ...
            "7" - Level 80
        }
    }
}

Armor and weapons must be an array of item numbers. The order is not strict, but it makes it easier to keep track of. Here's a template.

ARMOR   -   "GEAR_LEVEL_MINUS_10": [ HELM, NECKLACE, SHOULDERS, CAPE, CHEST, WRIST, HANDS, LEGS, BOOTS, RING1, TRINKET1 ]
WEAPON   -  "GEAR_LEVEL_MINUS_10": [ MAIN_HAND, OFFHAND, RING2, TRINKET2, RANGED_OR_RELIC ]
